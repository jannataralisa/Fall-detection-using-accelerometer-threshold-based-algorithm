In this research project, a smartphone accelerometer-based fall detection system has been
analyzed. A third-party Android application has been used to collect accelerometer data
produced by the user. The collected dataset has an ADL (Activity of Daily Life) value.
A threshold-based algorithm, Accelerometer Change-based Falls Detection
An algorithm (ACFDA) on datasets has been implemented, and the performance has been evaluated using different machine learning classifiers.
The ACFDA differentiates falls from regular human activity by getting the rapid changes of signal in vertical axes and the average value of
signal magnitude vector (SMV).
